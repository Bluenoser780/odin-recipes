    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Nova Scotia blueberry grunt is a classic East Coast fruit dessert! This is a very simple, traditional recipe which makes the most of seasonal wild blueberries.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>For The Blueberries</li>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups wild blueberries, fresh or frozen</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For The Dumplings</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring the blueberries, water, sugar, and butter to a boil in a medium-large pot that has a tight-fitting lid. Cook the blueberries for 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to simmer the berries until the liquid is syrupy, about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the berries are cooking make the dumpling dough. In a medium-large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt with a fork. Using your hands, rub the butter into the flour until the mixture is coarse and crumbly. Add the milk, then use a fork to mix everything together to a soft dough. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the berries are cooked, use a spoon to drop chunks of dumpling dough all over the hot berries. Keep going until all of the dough has been used. Cover the pot with a large square of parchment paper and top it with the pot lid. Continue to simmer the berries for 15 minutes. Do not open the pot lid while the dumplings are steaming.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid from the pot, and ***carefully*** lift off the parchment paper (be mindful of the hot steam underneath the paper which can burn your skin!!!). The top of the paper will be quite wet from the condensation of cooking. Do not let it spill into the pot! Serve blueberry grunt warm from the pot topped with ice cream or whipped cream or both.</li>
    </ol>
